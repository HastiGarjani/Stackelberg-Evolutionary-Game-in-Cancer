# Stackelberg-Evolutionary-Game-in-Cancer
- Via the code in "Find_Stackelberg_Solution", we find the Stackelberg solution that maximizes the quality of life.
- Via the code in "MTD_Nash_Stackelberg_Illustration," the Stabilization region, Quality of life level curves, and MTD, Nash, and Stackelberg solutions are illustrated.
- The code "Check_eigenvalues_of_Jacobian" finds the negative eigenvalues of the interior equilibrium point.
- The code "Subset of the region of attraction" illustrates figure B2.
